# moeston
 This project is dedicated to forum user moe, who posted some maps 11 years ago that never found a use in game. I found one now.


If you do not want to get spoiled, you should propably not be here.

This project includes 68 maps alongside 6 quests.\
Main part is the new town called "Moeston" located in the middle of the Moeston Forest. The people living in this area are very disconnected from the rest of Dhayavar but have a strong connection to nature.\
There is a small castle near the town, which has been used by knights in the past but is now a place for Feygard to control river traffic and trade.\
A small dug out cave can be found where some people planned to raid the castle of Guynmart. However, they never returned.\
Below the waterfalls coming from the mountains to the north, there is a huge lush cave with many unique plants and a very unique person being lost in there...\
Near the transition of the Moeston Forest over towards the Plateau area, there is a hunter's cabin with a small enclosure for injured wild animals.\
\
You can access most of those maps, including the castle and Moeston, from the fields north-east of Guynmart. The others can be accessed near the Iqhan cave.\
There are many connection points for further map developing, especially to the north. These points being on moesforest_00, 04, 12, 13, 17, 18 and moesplateau_01.\
