This file is just for documentation and provides additional background information for every single map in this project.  
It is meant to help mapmakers connect their maps to these in the future. Also, please see this as a suggestion rather than a fixed plan. This is just what I've got in mind.  
  
DM me anywhere if i missed any placeholder ??? once the project releases.

> This one resembles "dark_forrest04" by Moe. It has several levels of grass connected with stairs. There is one big red flower that could be used for an item drop or a quest in the future.
> This map can connect to the north, where there is a fence for now. This fence should stay, but can open up an area that leads further up the mountain, maybe towards the spring of the river.
