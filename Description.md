This file is just for documentation and provides additional background information for every single map in this project.  
It is meant to help mapmakers connect their maps to these in the future. Also, please see this as a suggestion rather than a fixed plan. This is just what I've got in mind.  
  
DM me anywhere if i missed any placeholder ??? once the project releases.

> This map contains a small human-made cave, that was used in an attempt to break into Guynmart Castle. The path leading to the north connects the Guynmart area to a village, called ???.  
> Up the stairs and to the east, this map leads to Moeston.  
> This map is supposed to be connected as follows:
> +A few more maps with brown cavemaps to the left and green walls to the right, but narrowest point is directly above this map. Opens up further north. About 3 Maps up to the village.  

> 01:
> This is just a filler map containing a few different animal-like monsters as boars and wolves.

> 02:
> This map contains a small, old castle, formerly used by Guynmart as an outpost. Nowadays, this is being used by Feygard Officials to control boat traffic on the big river.
> A mapchange needs to occur in order to make the "bridge" walkable.

> 03:
> There is a fisherman standing next to the crate and barrel, catching some fish with his rod. The road sign says "Moeston" towards south-west and "Guynmart" towards north-east.
> The cross says "Here lies Moe. His creative mind inspired many."

> 04:
> This one resembles "dark_forrest04" by Moe. It has several levels of grass connected with stairs. There is one big red flower that could be used for an item drop or a quest in the future.
> This map can connect to the north, where there is a fence for now. This fence should stay, but can open up an area that leads further up the mountain, maybe towards the river spring.

> 05:
> South-west part of Moeston. There is a large field, a tailor and the towns inn. On the river, there is a jetty. Mapchange includes boat next to the jetty.
  
> 06:
> North-west part of Moeston. There is a little hut, the church with cemetery, half of the smiths home as well as half the town hall. A little flower garden is located behind the town hall.

> This map is meant to connect the Moeston-Project to omicronrg9's Erumentemple-Project. There is a bridge and a broken rope ladder.  
> This map is supposed to be connected as follows:  
> +The player cannot climb up unless the rope is let down from above. So he cannot reach the new maps from this point on.
